Jonathan studies transitions in electric power systems and architectures for new paradigms in delivering electricity to less developed economies. His work spans from the technical details of power system design and control to the social dimensions of energy use and resource sharing.

Most of his focus is on solar microgrids with battery storage, but he also studies power system design and renewable energy integration more broadly.

Jonathan has several years of field experience designing and building solar power systems in East Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia, and he is a co-founder of and consultant with [New Sun Road](https://www.newsunroad.com/), a public benefit corporation working on electrification in less developed economies.
